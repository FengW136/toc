# Project Donation Process


- You can set up a proposal by submitting an issue in the [TOC repo](https://github.com/nextarch/toc).
  - The information should contain the project name, Area, Abstract, Goal, SIG belonging, and Presentation Materials.
  - If the project doesnâ€™t belong to any existing SIG, you can submit an issue in the toc repo to discuss whether to set up a new SIG.
- The SIG that the new project belongs will review the project and give advice. After improvement, the SIG Tech Leader will recommend the project to TOC.
- TOC will vote for the project at the TOC meeting and announce it at the meeting (approved by a two-thirds vote).
- The incubation of the projects will be determined by TOC in the future.
