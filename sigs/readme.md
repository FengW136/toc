# NextArch Foundation Special Interest Groups ("SIGs")

## Overall Purpose
Scale contributions by the NextArch Foundation technical and user community, while retaining integrity and increasing quality in support of our mission.

## Introduction
NextArch SIGs will oversee and coordinate the interests pertaining to a logical area of needs of end users and/or projects. 
The area overseen by a SIG is typically met by a set of NextArch Foundation projects, and may also represent a cross-cutting feature group shared by several projects. SIGâ€™s are:

long lived groups that report to the Technical Advisory Council
led primarily by recognised experts in the relevant field(s), supported by other contributors
